For Differential Gene Expression steps, check out the following packages and their respective vignettes:  

[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)

[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)

[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html)   


After Differential Gene Expression Analysis, it is common to perform a pathway analysis. The following packages and programs are rather useful for these steps:  

[clusterprofileR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html)

[EnrichR Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enrichR/vignettes/enrichR.html)

[EnrichR Web](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)
